Type: Runtime Spec

## Summary

This NEP introduces the request of adding into the NEAR runtime set of pre-compile
functions that can help IBC compatible light clients run on-chain.

## Motivation

In order to deploy a light client that’s able to verify the state of a chain within
another chain, there’s a need to verify signatures. Signature verification and hashing are
ubiquitous operations, especially in PoS consensus mechanisms.

Our rough numbers say that we’ll be verifying ~200 signatures every minute (Polkadot’s
authority set is 300 signers). Therefore, we need a mechanism to perform these operations
in a cost-effective way in terms of gas and speed. Currently, NEAR does not have any native
signature verification toolbox. This implies that a light client operating insid NEAR will have
to import a library compiled to WASM as mentioned in
[Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/light_client).

With regards to hashing, there are already several hashing functions implemented natively.
For our use case, we need to be able to use `blake2b` has function, which is not available.

## Rationale and alternatives

Add

```rust
pub fn ed25519_verify(sig: &ed25519::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &ed25519::Public) -> bool
pub fn sr25519_verify(sig: &sr25519::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &sr25519::Public) -> bool
pub fn ecdsa_verify(sig: &ecdsa::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &ecdsa::Public) -> bool
pub fn blake2b(nn: usize, k: &[u8], data: &[u8]) -> Result<[u8; 32], Error>
```

using `blake2_rfc`, `ed25519_dalek`, `schnorrkel` and `secp256k1` crates into NEAR runtime as pre-compiled functions.

We've tried running a signature verifier smart contract on-chain using our own wasm
module powered by widespread used crypto Rust crates. The biggest pitfall of that solution
is performance and cost. Our [benchamarks](https://github.com/blasrodri/near-test) show the following results:

With `iterations = 130` **all these calls return ExecutionError**: `'Exceeded the maximum amount of gas allowed to burn per contract.'`
With iterations = 50 these are the results:

```
ed25518: tx id 6DcJYfkp9fGxDGtQLZ2m6PEDBwKHXpk7Lf5VgDYLi9vB (299 Tgas)
schnorrkel: tx id ACYJh7YC4pQM8fu7DsjmmkSb3WSvikfQkVyej3htiuDQ (304 Tgas)
ecdsa: tx id 2FhtFEbakuwQyHWcyeRoPkCDgXz4erTYSD75QkxDTb2e (185 Tgas)
```

- What is the impact of not doing this?
  Costs of running IBC compatible trustless bridges would be very high. Plus, the fact that signature verification
  is such an expensive operation will force the contract to split the process of batch verification of signatures
  into multiple transactions.

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
  Adding exisiting proved and vetted crypto crates into the runtime is a safe workaround. It will boost performance
  between 20-25x according to our benchmarks. This will both reduce operation costs significantly and will also
  enable the contract to verify all the signatures in one transaction, which will simplify the contract design.

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
  This has been answered before.

## Specification

Once this NEP is approved and integrated, these four functions will be available in the `near_sdk` crate in the
`env` module.

## Security Implications (Optional)

We have chosen these crates because they are the ones already integrated in the [sp_io](https://docs.rs/sp-io/latest/sp_io/)
crate heavily used in the [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) repository.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the NEP process before this gets merged?
  Both the function signatures and crates are up for discussion.

## Future possibilities

I currently do not envision any extension in this regard.
