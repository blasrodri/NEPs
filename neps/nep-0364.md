## Summary

This NEP introduces the request of adding into the NEAR runtime a set of pre-compile
functions that can help IBC compatible light clients run on-chain.

## Motivation

Signature verification and hashing are ubiquitous operations in light clients,
especially in PoS consensus mechanisms. Based on the Polkadot's consensus mechanism
there will be a need for verification of ~200 signatures every minute
(Polkadotâ€™s authority set is ~300 signers and it may be incresed in the future: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/16).

Therefore, a mechanism to perform these operations in a cost-effective way
in terms of gas and speed would be highly beneficial to have. Currently, NEAR does not have any native signature verification toolbox.
This implies that a light client operating insid NEAR will have to import a library
compiled to WASM as mentioned in [Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/light_client).

Polkadot uses [three different cryptographic schemes](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-keys)
for its keys/accounts, which also translates into different signatures types:

- The vanilla ed25519 implementation using Schnorr signatures.
- The Schnorrkel/Ristretto sr25519 variant using Schnorr signatures.
- ECDSA signatures on secp256k1

## Rationale and alternatives

Add three signature verification signatures functions into the runtime as host functions.

- ED25519 signature verification function
- SR25519 signature verification function
- ECDSA signature verification function

using `ed25519_dalek`, `schnorrkel` and `secp256k1` crates into NEAR runtime as pre-compiled functions.

Note: seems like `ecdsa_verify` is implemented, but called `erecover` in https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/runtime/near-vm-logic/src/logic.rs#L1049
Upon confirmation, we can proceed to remove it.

Benchmarks were run using a signature verifier smart contract on-chain importing the aforementioned functions from
widespread used crypto Rust crates. The biggest pitfall of that solution
is performance and cost. Our [benchamarks](https://github.com/blasrodri/near-test) show the following results:

With `iterations = 130` **all these calls return ExecutionError**: `'Exceeded the maximum amount of gas allowed to burn per contract.'`
With iterations = 50 these are the results:

```
ed25518: tx id 6DcJYfkp9fGxDGtQLZ2m6PEDBwKHXpk7Lf5VgDYLi9vB (299 Tgas)
schnorrkel: tx id ACYJh7YC4pQM8fu7DsjmmkSb3WSvikfQkVyej3htiuDQ (304 Tgas)
ecdsa: tx id 2FhtFEbakuwQyHWcyeRoPkCDgXz4erTYSD75QkxDTb2e (185 Tgas)
```

- Performance in wall clock time when you compile the signature validation library directly from rust to native.
  Here are the results on a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core Processor machine:

```
# 10k signature verifications
ed25519: took 387ms
ecdsa: took 324ms
shnorrkel: took 411ms
```

- Performance in wall clock time when you compile the library into wasm first and then use the single-pass compiler in Wasmer 1 to then compile to native.

```
ed25519: took 9926ms
ecdsa: took 6725ms
shnorrkel: took 10220ms
```

As an extra datapoint, when passing `--enable-simd` instead of `--singlepass`

```
ed25519: took 3085ms
ecdsa: took 1895ms
shnorrkel: took 3179ms
```

Steps to reproduce:
commit: `31cf97fb2e155d238308f062c4b92bae716ac19f` in `https://github.com/blasrodri/near-test`

```sh
# wasi singlepass
cargo wasi build --bin benches --release
wasmer compile --singlepass ./target/wasm32-wasi/release/benches.wasi.wasm -o benches_singlepass
wasmer run ./benches_singlepass
```

```sh
# rust native
cargo run --bin benches --release
```

Overall: the difference between the two versions (native vs wasi + singlepass are)

```
ed25519: 25.64x slower
ecdsa: 20.75x slower
shnorrkel: 24.86x slower
```

### What is the impact of not doing this?

Costs of running IBC compatible trustless bridges would be very high. Plus, the fact that signature verification
is such an expensive operation will force the contract to split the process of batch verification of signatures
into multiple transactions.

### Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

Adding exisiting proved and vetted crypto crates into the runtime is a safe workaround. It will boost performance
between 20-25x according to our benchmarks. This will both reduce operation costs significantly and will also
enable the contract to verify all the signatures in one transaction, which will simplify the contract design.

### What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

Adding exisiting proved and vetted crypto crates into the runtime is a safe workaround. It will boost performance
between 20-25x according to our benchmarks. This will both reduce operation costs significantly and will also
enable the contract to verify all the signatures in one transaction, which will simplify the contract design.

## Specification

This NEP aims to introduce the following host functions:

```rust
pub fn ed25519_verify(sig: &ed25519::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &ed25519::Public) -> bool
pub fn sr25519_verify(sig: &sr25519::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &sr25519::Public) -> bool
pub fn ecdsa_verify(sig: &ecdsa::Signature, msg: &[u8], pub_key: &ecdsa::Public) -> bool
```

Once this NEP is approved and integrated, these four functions will be available in the `near_sdk` crate in the
`env` module.

## Security Implications (Optional)

We have chosen these crates because they are the ones already integrated in the [sp_io](https://docs.rs/sp-io/latest/sp_io/)
crate heavily used in the [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) repository.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the NEP process before this gets merged?
  Both the function signatures and crates are up for discussion.

## Future possibilities

I currently do not envision any extension in this regard.
